                <p><b>A better MARTA is a better Atlanta.</b></p>
                <p>I strongly advocate for the expansion and improvement of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA).</p>
                <p><b>A better MARTA would:</b></p>
                <li>Reduce <b>commute times</b> and <b>traffic congestion</b></li>
                <li>Create <b>equitable</b> economic opportunities</li>
                <li>Give people more <b>freedom</b> and <b>choice</b> in transportation</li>
                <p>Just to be clear: <b>Expanding MARTA does NOT bring crime.</b></p>

                <p>I am of the belief that no one should get screwed over by insurance companies or go bankrupt or suffer, 
                    just because they get sick for any reason. 
                    We should be able to provide quality healthcare to EVERYONE in the United States, 
                    for a better, healthier nation.

                    The hate against this community is so unwarranted and senseless, it's disappointing to see. 
                    Just let people be themselves, man.

                <p>In accordance with leaving the fruits of hope behind,
                    education is an upmost priority in my view. 
                    A quality and holistic education for all children is essential to better our society.
                    An educated and informed populace can do wonders for us and our planet, 
                    while simultaneously preventing bad actors from establishing significant influence.

                <h2>Billionaires should not exist.</h2>
                <p>CRAZY, I know. That people with such ridiculous amounts of wealth,
                    built off of the work of those beneath them, should NOT exist? Insane.
                    In all seriousness, it is an absolutely disgusting tragedy that such wealth
                    can exist while simultaneously there are countless people other there unable
                    to afford food, water, even a home. There are people suffering, all the while
                    these elite live lavishly. This is not "meritocracy". This is not what capitalism
                    should be. This is an RNG game with a terrible progression system.
                    In accordance with sowing kindness, sowing humility, and leaving behind the fruits of hope,
                    this is completely and utterly unacceptable. We can do better, folks.
                    Remember: one race, one house.
